  "about_project_description": "This project was developed by the research group L@itec - Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de São Paulo - Câmpus Campinas in order to integrate the teaching-learning process of chemistry with the new technologies of Augmented Reality (AR). Chemistry teaching represents one of the most expressive examples of the impact that mobile technologies can promote, arousing students' curiosity to understand and visualize theories from a new perspective. Thus, the integration of smartphones with Augmented Reality applications is an innovative method of teaching spatial reasoning skills to chemistry students. Therefore, through the use of mobile devices one can take advantage of the AR application and visualize chemical molecules that illustrate molecule structures for the topics of molecular geometry, spatial isomerism and biochemical structures, being possible to analyze and understand the topic with interactivity and dynamic visualization resources.",
